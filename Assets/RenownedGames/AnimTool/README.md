## AnimTool

AnimTool allows you to setup a lot of animations in a couple of clicks!

AnimTool is a tool with which you no longer need to spend a lot of time setting up your animations.

*For example, when you import 100 new animations into a project, you need to setup each of them, rename it, set the type, avatar and etc. If you do it manually, it may take you several hours.*

AnimTool allows you to set a pattern according to which you need to configure all the selected animations. After that, you just have to press the button and the system will do everything for you in a few seconds!
